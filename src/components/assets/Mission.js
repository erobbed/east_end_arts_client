      Southampton Arts and Culture Committee (SHACC) believes in the essential role of arts and culture in daily life. Dedicated to supporting our artistic community through collaboration while encouraging appreciation and access to a variety of audiences that serve the best interests of the public. SHACC seeks to inspire aesthetic engagement and promote familiarity with art in its historical, cultural, and social contexts. It is a forum for artists and arts professionals across disciplines, practices and cultures with the explicit mandate of exploring and exchanging ideas in open discussions of timely issues that engage our east end community. Reflecting our history and confronting the present with the goal of creating the cultural landscape we want to live in is the primary mission of the Southampton Arts and Culture Committee.
